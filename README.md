## Week 1, 25/07/25

This website is for the public to officially sign up to a community run charity website that helps those people in need. It receives data input from sign up members, including location, to figure out the best way to help the community. It encourages people to either donate items that are bought, as well as building items using wood etc. When someone signs up, they will provide basic details like name, email, number, and location. This data will be transferred to an sql database and sorted in different sections, based on location. Once on the home page, they will be led to a tutorial that automatically plays for the first time that introduces them to the website to understand it. A settings/profile page is essential for the person to change data. The big thing that someone can do is report/say that they have something for donation, where they will be informed about what to donate, why donate, and how to donate, including an interactive element to decide what to donate. After they confirm they have something to donate through a form, they will be told about where to drop off the item and other details, as well as a link for people donating big products like mattresses or beds, that asks for help from the nearby community to load or lug the stuff to the location if they cannot do it. This page will also have information about how to do it yourself. From the sign up page, a member is allowed to apply to receive donations when in a time of need. They will be required to fill out information confirming their identity and financial situation. The data received from this will go into a database that logs what they need, and throughout the year, they will be placed onto a waiting list that attempts to find items donated by the public.
